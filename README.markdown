# Music Machine for iPhone

Music Machine for iPhone (MM iPhone) is a client to the [Music Machine server](http://github.com/nollbit/MusicMachineServer) project. Server URL configuration is found in the normal Settings app.

This is a very early release, it only supports a manually updated status view of the currently playing track and upcoming playlist.

## Install instructions

1. Clone this repository.
1. Clone the [Three20](http://github.com/facebook/three20) library in the same root folder as MM iPhone.

3. Install app onto iPhone or Simulator.
4. Go to Settings > mmiphone, and enter the URL for your server.
