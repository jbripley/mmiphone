# Music Machine for iPhone

Music Machine for iPhone (MM iPhone) is a client to the [Music Machine server](http://github.com/nollbit/MusicMachineServer) project. We (currently) assumes that a server is running on `http://localhost:8080` for this app to function.

This is a very early release and only supports a manually updated status view of the currently playing track.

## Install instructions

1. This project uses the [Three20](http://github.com/facebook/three20) library and you need to have it checked out in the same root folder as MM iPhone.
2. A Xcode project is included and you should be able to it normally in Xcode 3.2.2
